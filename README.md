# PathfindingBasic
This is a very basic pathfinding game algorithm in Javascript, visualized in a 2 dimensional view of a virtual city and a robot, which uses the streets of the city to move to the target. Multidimensional arrays are used to display the city and to generate the path to the target from the current position of the robot. The script is implemented and displayed in a html file using css. Thus it can be opened by any familar browsers like Chrome etc. You can open the file under the following URL:__[http://www.littleorange.de/pathfinding/pathfinding.html](http://www.littleorange.de/pathfinding/pathfinding.html)__. I appreciate any comments, critics and hints - Thank you in advance.
