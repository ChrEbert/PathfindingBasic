# PathfindingBasic
This is a very basic pathfinding game algorithm in Javascript, visualized in a 2 dimensional view of a virtual city and a robot, which uses the streets of the city to move to the target. Multidimensional arrays are used to display the city and to generate the path to the target from the current position of the robot. The script is implemented and displayed in a html file using css. Thus it can be opened by any familar browsers like Chrome etc. You can open the file under the following URL:__[http://www.littleorange.de/pathfinding/pathfinding.html](http://www.littleorange.de/pathfinding/pathfinding.html)__ . I appreciate any comments, critics and hints - Thank you in advance. 

For describing the project there are 3 sections:
-Design / Initialisation: Further informations how the city, it's buildings streets and "empty" fields are displayed, which technologies are used to achieve this, and how the robot is shown.
-Pathgenerating: This is the core point of the script: How is the way from the current to the target point determined. How it is saved for the visualisation of the movement of the robot?
-Visualisation the movement of the robot: Using a timespan for each point of the path from current point to target point.
